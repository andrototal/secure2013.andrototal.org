          <aside class="notes">
            As you may easily guess, this presentation is going to be
            about Android.

            First of all I'm going to give you a brief overview of the
            most relevant threats and protections.

            Then, I will explain some of the current limitations,
            and explain you why it is important to conduct antimalware
            testing.

            After this introduction I will describe how AndroTotal
            works and how it can be used by anyone, and especially
            security researchers and companies, to conduct antimalware
            experiments.

            I will conclude my presentation with the current status of
            the AndroTotal project, the data that we collected so far,
            and our plans for the future, which include the
            collaboration with security vendors.

            * Rich marketplaces stocked with apps

            I think I'm giving no big news by saying that Android is
            the most popular mobile software platform: It actually
            holds 79 percent of the market.

            The Android ecosystem offers rich marketplaces with many
            apps.

            As it always happens, the more a system becomes popular,
            the more that system becomes an attractive target for
            malicious actors.

            * TrendMicro: ~509,000

          <aside class="notes">
            The actual number of "threats" is not very relevant
            because, depending at what we consider as "one instance"
            of a threat, the numbers vary from vendor to vendor.

            According to Google's last week talk at Virus Bulletin
            Conference, this threat landscape is vastly exaggerated,
            and that despite the large number of malware samples, the
            actual infections are very rare.

            We can see that there is an interest by looking at trends
            like the one depicted in this slide, which comes from
            TrendMicro.

            Even though the actual numbers can vary significantly
            depending on what we consider as "one threat", all the
            security vendors and researchers agree that in the past
            two years there has been a growth in the number of
            malicious applications.

            So, let's see what are the main goals of the attackers in this context.

            Given the substantial amount of sensitive data that we
            exchange with our smartphones, the attackers are certainly
            interested in it. Think for instance about a phone call, text message,
            or email that carry confidential information such as you online banking
            credentials.

            Given the stable Internet connectivity and the great
            computational power of modern smartphones, attackers are
            also interested in botnet-like functionalities, used later on for subsequent
            infections, information stealing and financial gain through premium
            texting and calling.

          <aside class="notes">
            Indeed, Google takes Android security very seriously. It adopts a layered
            approach.

            First, applications and developers on the Google Play marketplace are subject
            to very thorough checks.

            Although we all known that the human user is the weakest
            link, another security measure is that applications cannot
            be installed without the user's explicit approval.

            Then, them most recent versions of Android adopt SMS and call blacklisting
            and quota mechanism to mitigate the apps that contact premium numbers that
            pay a commission to the malware developer.

            There are also so-called "runtime checks", which are meant to
            verify that an application isn't known to be malicious by communicating
            back with Google's server. Pretty much like Google Safebrowsing does
            when we use Chrome to visit websites.

            Most importantly, apps are sandboxed.

            ### App Sandboxing

            <img width="50%" src="img/android.png" />

            "Sensitive" operations require static permissions
          </script>

          <aside class="notes">
            Each app is run within a dedicated Linux process. This
            means that the underlying operating system takes care of
            resource isolation. For instance, a running app cannot
            access the memory space of another running app.

            In addition, each app is run within a dedicated virtual
            machine. This is done primarily for efficiency reasons,
            but it also allows a better decoupling of the access to
            the operating system's resources.

            ### Antimalware Apps are Constrained

            <ul class="fragment">

            <li class="fragments">Workarounds:

            </li>
            </ul>
          </script>

          <aside class="notes">
            First of all, antimalware apps cannot inspect other
            running apps to run security checks. This is due to the
            sandboxing mechanism, which has no primitives to allow
            security auditing of other apps.

            The workaround is that current antimalware apps must
            resort to classic approaches based on checking suspicious
            applications against a database of static signatures.

            This can be done when a new application is installed, or by
            scanning the storage partition.

            Some antimalware apps allow to check the entire filesystem,
            but, because of the security model, they require root
            privileges, which can be done only if the user knows how
            to root his or her smartphone.

          <aside class="notes">
            Similar limitations also apply to malicious applications, which
            are left with less freedom because each malware sample is itself an
            isolated app.

            The workaround is that malware authors resort to social engineering
            techniques to get their apps installed, for instance by distributing
            free clones of paid applications along with their malicious code.

            Then, since antimalware mostly resort to static signatures, malware authors
            can easily evade them by creating simple variants of the same family,
            for instance through simple obfuscation techniques.

            Let's say that we have a database of one thousand malware samples, which
            is quite a conservative choice.

            We apply 10 code transformation algorithms. This number
            includes the most popular obfuscation algorithms.

            And we run this collection against one hundred antimalware
            products, which is the number of security apps that we
            could find on the Google Play store.

            Well, this is quite a significant number of tests.

            We have started the AndroTotal project because we have noticed that there

            VirusTotal is a great tool and service in this direction and it is
            capable of analyzing Android applications with proper signatures from
            vendors.

            However, it uses command-line versions of desktop-based antiviruses, enriched
            with signatures of known Android malware.

            So, although it is very useful for detecting which vendors detect what, it
            does not uses the actual Android antimalware applications that an end-user
            would install on his or her device.

            The state of the art of the research in this direction is focused on
            showing the robustness of current Android antimalware applications against
            code obfuscation.

            Given the known limitations of static signatures matching,
            which is still the best that an antimalware app is allowed
            to do because of the security model, the result of these
            researches are not very surprising: most of the static
            signatures cannot possibly detect variants if they are
            strongly obfuscated.

            This is not very surprising, and I'm not blaming the antimalware apps, of
            course. If it would be possible for them to do auditing of running apps,
            they would be able to do tell benign and malicious apps apart by their
            dynamic behavior, rather than by looking at their code.

            We created AndroTotal not with the purpose of showing, by comparative
            analysis, that a certain vendor is better than another vendor.

            Our purpose is to give the research community a reference tool for
            performing automated tests, and to get labels of suspicious samples.

            Additionally, our goal is also to give the vendors a way
            to quickly test their products on several versions of
            Android, and under different conditions.

            This is what AndroTotal is meant to be.

            Of course, you need an API key for that.

            We're beta testing some code-transformation routines that
            can be applied before running an analysis.

            However, we haven't release them to the public yet, and we
            will probably never do it. We may give access to these
            functionalities only to vendors.

            We're also testing it on physical devices, although in principle
            we don't use any emulator-specific functionalities. So, it
            should work without problems also on physical devices.

            Among the malicious or potentially harmful applications, here we

            However, as it always happens with malware labeling, the
            same sample can be given different labels from different
            vendors. This is a minor issue, but it's quite annoying when

            Here is what we're planning for the future.

            From a technical point of view, our workers can barely
            keep the pace, so we would like to add more hardware to
            scale.

            Next, I'm working on cross-checking the labels assigned by
            the vendors supported from both VirusTotal and AndroTotal.

            Another interesting direction is the deployment of
            physical workers on ARM boards, to gather data that cannot
            be obtained from the emulator. An example is the amount of
            battery power consumed by each antimalware. Battery is an
            extremely important resource, and I'd say that it is also
            a barrier that may limit the adoption of sophisticated
            antimalware products because, despite their efficiency,
            they may consume too much battery power.

            Last, we're collecting a list of people, institutions,
            companies, vendors, interested in participating into a
            cooperative repository for Android malware collection,
            available for no-profit purposes such as academic
            research.
